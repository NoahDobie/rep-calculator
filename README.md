# Rep Calculator

This project is a 1 Rep Max + more Calculator built with React. It uses the many different formulas to estimate your one-repetition maximum (1RM) and other reps down to 50% based on the weight you lift and the number of repetitions you perform. The app also supports dark mode and saves your last input values for weight, reps, unit (lbs/kg), and lift type in local storage.
