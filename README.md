# Rep Calculator

This project is a 1 Rep Max + more Calculator built with React. It uses the Epley formula to estimate your one-repetition maximum (1RM) based on the weight you lift and the number of repetitions you perform. The app also supports dark mode and saves your last input values for weight, reps, and unit (lbs/kg) in local storage.

## Features

- Calculate 1 Rep Max using the Epley formula
